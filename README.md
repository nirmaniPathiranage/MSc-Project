# Project Name: DiabetCare -  An Artificial Intelligence based Mobile Application for Predicting the Risk of Prediabetes Mellitus, Gestational Diabetes Mellitus and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

The aim of this research is to design, develop and evaluate an automated novel approach in the face of a mobile application, for early prediction of the risk of having 3 different types of diabetes mellitus, with less/without medical supervision, so that the application can be used in medical domain as a confirmation mechanism.

## The novelty in this research is that, the particular system can be specifically used by Sri Lankans, since Sri Lankan datasets obtained from Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya have been used for data training purposes.

# In-scope

- Decide best fitting approaches to implement risk prediction of diabetes mellitus types.

- A system that is capable of predicting whether a person (without age restriction) is having the risk of being diagnosed with prediabetes/type 2 diabetes or not, by using data entered by the user (both medical indicators and personal background information).

- Classify prediabetes/type 2 diabetes/no diabetes using machine learning algorithms + an ensemble architecture.

- A system that is capable of predicting whether a pregnant woman is having the risk of being diagnosed with gestational diabetes or not, by using data entered by the user (both medical indicators and personal background information).

- Classify gestational diabetes/no diabetes using machine learning algorithms + an ensemble architecture.

- Comparative analysis with several ensemble stacks and choose the best approach.

- Evaluate the performance of the system.

- Graphical User Interface in the face of a mobile application for the users to enter data and for the risk prediction results to be shown (user interaction and communication)

The above prototype feature diagram shows the illustrative concept of the prototype and the expected outcome along with the underlying process of the system.

The risk prediction system that is going to be implemented is composed of 2 components:

## Component 01: 
Initially the user will type/select the answers asked in the mobile application regarding his/her health indicators/personal background related questions. According to the answers given by the user, it will be predicted through the finalized machine learning based ensemble model, whether the particular user is having the risk of being diagnosed with prediabetes, type 2 diabetes or not. Can be used by any person without age limits.

## Component 02: 
Initially the user will type/select the answers asked in the mobile application regarding her health indicators/personal background related questions. According to the answers given by the user, it will be predicted through the finalized machine learning based ensemble model, whether the particular user is having the risk of being diagnosed with gestational diabetes or not. Can be used by pregnant women.

***Each component can be used by the mentioned types of users according to their preference.
